# Plugify  Challenge

## Description

The challenge is to create a search autocomplete input backed by the Plugify API.

Users should be able to start typing in the input, and the input should start showing them suggestions as provided by the API.

## Technology and packages used

The app is built using React.
Packages installed:
- Material-UI: user interface library, it provides styled React components out of the box. I find it useful when implementing prototypes or for projects where the design is not the main focus or not specified, as it saves a lot of time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
